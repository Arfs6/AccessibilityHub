## Accessibility Hub

This project is a web application that allows users to review and rate the accessibility of apps and websites.
Users can also search for apps and websites that are accessible to them based on their disability.
The goal of this project is to help users find apps and websites that are accessible to them and to help developers create more accessible apps and websites.
